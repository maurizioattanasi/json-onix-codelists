				<td>Update (partial)</td>
				<td>In ONIX 3.0 only, use when sending a &#8216;block update&#8217; record. A block update implies using the supplied block(s) to update the existing record for the product, replacing only the blocks included in the block update, and leaving other blocks unchanged &#8211; for example, replacing old information from Blocks 4 and 6 with the newly-received data while retailing information from Blocks 1&#8211;3 and 5 untouched. In previous ONIX releases, and for ONIX 3.0 using other notification types, updating is by replacing the complete record with the newly-received data</td>
			</tr>
			<tr valign="top">
				<td>05</td>
				<td>Delete</td>
				<td>Use when sending an instruction to delete a record which was previously issued. Note that a Delete instruction should NOT be used when a product is cancelled, put out of print, or otherwise withdrawn from sale: this should be handled as a change of Publishing status, leaving the receiver to decide whether to retain or delete the record. A Delete instruction is used ONLY when there is a particular reason to withdraw a record completely, eg because it was issued in error</td>
